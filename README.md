IT products ecommerce project
This is an undergoing project that I started few days ago. I plan to finish it up by May as this is going to be my banchelor degree's final project.

I chose vanilla JS/CSS 'cause I think the most important things are those who give you the required base, but after this project I'll consider React as my front-end framework and maybe transtion from PHP to NodeJs as server-side scripting language.

I plan to make a slightly clone of eMAG website out of this project 'cause I like its look and feel.

By now I have implemented the login system for users.
